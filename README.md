# RS011-battleship

## About:
The Battleship is a guessing game for two players. Players place ships on their boards and guess where are opponent's ships. The goal of this game is to sink all of the opponent's ships. Players take turn. If player is correct than it's his turn again, or if he misses than it's opponent's turn to play.

## Rules:
All ships must be placed correctly, without overlaping. Ships are placed between two clicked squares on board. Options are horizontal and vertical. When that is done player clicks on Ready button and the game begins. In this implementation there are two modes:

1. two players against each other

2. one player against the machine
